# Django Study Project ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

This is a result of Django project based on a tutorial by [**@SteinOveHelset**](https://github.com/SteinOveHelset) on his YouTube video at [Code With Stein](https://youtu.be/m3nYd_IFZuU?si=gfT9p9uXlUuEC1an). It serves as a great starting point for learning Django basics including models, views, templates, and routing.

ðŸ“º **Credits**  
Huge thanks to [Stein Helset](https://github.com/SteinOveHelset) for the original video tutorial.  
If you're just starting out with Django, check out his video and follow step-by-step instruction â€” it's super beginner-friendly and clear.

**Note**  
This repository contains additional features that make project result different from original video tutorial.
